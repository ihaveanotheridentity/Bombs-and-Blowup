You are a 15 year old living with your family, you enjoy your time with them and they enjoy you. It's not untill a strange knock on the door comes. Your mother suspects nothing, but opening it leads to a gunshot to the head. Boom, on the floor bleeding. It is not a pleasent site to see. In fear, you go and find shelter to call 911. The black robed figure has zaped away in fog as the cops are calling. You are worried for you and the rest of your family.
